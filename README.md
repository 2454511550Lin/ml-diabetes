# ML For Glucose Predicion

## Preparation

Please download the cleaned dataset using thin link[] and put it in the root directory. See below:

## Demo
one_module_demo.ipynb: an example of using KNN regression to predict the 10-week glucose level of mice, for a specific module in a spesific tissue

demo.py: an example of using KNN regression to predict the 10-week glucose level of mice, FOR ALL MODULES in ALL TISSUES. An sample output file is presented in result/knn.csv

## Notes

- The number of mice across different tissues are not consistant

- We use 50 mice for testing, these 50 mice are the same across different tissues

-
